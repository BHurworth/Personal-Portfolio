# Personal-Portfolio
## A small website designed to showcase my personal projects, photography and practise learning new topics.
### This is/was my first project. It will be constantly updated as my skills improve. As of writing this I am learning javascript on the side. I then plan to learn React.js and eventually learn about backend development including databases and cloud hosting. I plan to make a large project with these skills and then will possibly move on to app development. - 14/03/2021.

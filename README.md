## Reflection

I create this side project as one of my first projects. It introduced me to html, css and javascript. My goal was to build a person site which would showcase my 
development and projects.

This project was fairly challenging, as I had very little experience programming and had never touched html/css/js before. It was very enjoyable to overcome
this challenge and see myself improve, however.

I used html/css/js to create this project. I chose to use vanilla javascript, where possible, so that my skills would increase. I also felt that a base knowledge
in html/css would serve me for a lifetime. In the future, I would like to add more features with external modules and by adding more javascript.
